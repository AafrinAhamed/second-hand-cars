# second-hand-cars
I have solved this database in R programming platform.
Being a vast dataset, I have split them to premium and general model cars.
Made preprocessing like splitting certain columns based on requirement, treated missing values, cleaned the dataset
Predictive modeling is made and rmse is found.
